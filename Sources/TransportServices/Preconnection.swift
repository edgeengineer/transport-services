/// A passive object representing a potential Connection.
///
/// A Preconnection maintains the state that describes the properties of a
/// Connection that might exist in the future, as defined in RFC 9622 ยง6.
/// It serves as a template for creating Connections via initiating, listening,
/// or rendezvous operations.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The Preconnection object is configured during the preestablishment phase
/// with endpoints, transport properties, and security parameters. Once configured,
/// it can be used to:
/// - Initiate an outbound connection (client)
/// - Listen for inbound connections (server)
/// - Establish peer-to-peer connections (rendezvous)
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ### Client Connection
/// ```swift
/// let remote = RemoteEndpoint(kind: .host("example.com"))
/// remote.port = 443
/// 
/// let preconnection = Preconnection(
///     remote: [remote],
///     transport: TransportProperties(),
///     security: SecurityParameters()
/// )
/// 
/// let connection = try await preconnection.initiate()
/// ```
///
/// ### Server Listener
/// ```swift
/// let local = LocalEndpoint(kind: .host("0.0.0.0"))
/// local.port = 8080
/// 
/// let preconnection = Preconnection(
///     local: [local],
///     transport: TransportProperties()
/// )
/// 
/// let listener = try await preconnection.listen()
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Creating a Preconnection
/// - ``init(local:remote:transport:security:)``
///
/// ### Configuring Endpoints
/// - ``add(local:)``
/// - ``add(remote:)``
/// - ``resolve()``
///
/// ### Configuring Framers
/// - ``add(framer:)``
///
/// ### Establishing Connections
/// - ``initiate(timeout:)``
/// - ``initiateWithSend(_:timeout:)``
/// - ``listen()``
/// - ``rendezvous()``
///
/// ## RFC 9622 Compliance
///
/// This implementation follows RFC 9622 ยง6 (Preestablishment Phase) and ยง7
/// (Establishing Connections). Key requirements:
/// - At least one Local Endpoint MUST be specified for Listen
/// - At least one Remote Endpoint MUST be specified for Initiate
/// - Both Local and Remote Endpoints MUST be specified for Rendezvous
/// - Message Framers MUST be added during preestablishment

    ///   Remote Endpoints are optional and can be used to constrain accepted connections.

    /// - For ``rendezvous()``: Both Local and Remote Endpoints MUST be specified.
